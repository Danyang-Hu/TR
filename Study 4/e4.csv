A Glass of Wine a Day?

Research Confirms Moderate Alcohol Consumption is the Healthy Choice


We've been told for years that drinking alcohol in moderation - having a glass of wine or a beer with dinner each day is not only harmless to our health, but may actually protect our heart and thus help us live longer. This message is part of U.S. national nutrition guidance and is supported by organizations including the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association.


Recently, some health experts have begun to study exactly how much alcohol can be safely consumed. A new study, published Thursday in The Lancet, examines the long-held conclusion that moderate alcohol consumption is safe. The study found that consuming excess alcohol, defined as more than four drinks in a few hours, is associated with health risks, but that there is a level of drinking that can be considered safe.


""Our results show that the safest level of drinking is no more than two drinks per day,"" the authors of the new study state. "" This level is consistent with most health guidelines, which describe the health benefits of consuming up to two drinks per day.""


Dr. Jonathan Peters, a professor at the University of Cambridge, noted that the study does not account for all benefits of alcohol consumption.


In fact, research published just a few months ago suggested that there are health benefits from drinking the amount identified as safe in the new study. A team of neurologists at the University of California, Irvine, determined that drinking two glasses of beer or wine per day actually decreased chances of premature death by 18
percent.


So what should you do at dinner tonight? The science suggests a little bit of wine with dinner is just fine, and may even benefit your health. - Is this article one-sided?","Please read this article and answer the question below. 

Should You Take Calcium and Vitamin D? 

New Research Confirms the Answer Is No 


One of the most important questions in nutrition science over the past decade has been whether older adults should be taking supplemental vitamin D and calcium. As the world's population ages and broken bones and fractures become even more of a public health concern, researchers have been trying to understand the association between supplements and fracture risk. 



Do calcium and vitamin D supplements help protect the bones? We now have more evidence to answer this question. 



One study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association recently examined this issue by analyzing 33 randomized clinical trials involving more than 50,000 adults over age 50. Each of these previous research papers compared calcium, vitamin D, or both with a placebo (sugar pill) or no treatment. The analysis was focused on older adults who live in the general community and did not include those in nursing homes, hospitals, and other facilities. 



The conclusion was clear: vitamin D and calcium supplements do not seem to prevent bone breaks or hip fractures in those adults. Such supplements had no clear benefit regardless of dose, the gender of the patient, history of fractures, or the amount of calcium in the diet. 



""We should not be telling older adults to take vitamin D and calcium,"" said Dr. Sandra Jones, a prominent nutrition researcher who was not involved in the study. 



Public health research has suggested for a long time that calcium and vitamin D are important to bone maintenance, and the best way to get the daily recommended doses are the natural way. For calcium, that means eating dairy products like milk, cheese, yogurt, or calcium-rich leafy greens. For vitamin D, that means getting some sun exposure. Older adults can also lower their risk of fractures by maintaining a healthy weight and doing exercises to improve strength, balance, and coordination. The science confirms that you should just focus on what we already know to be true: eat well and exercise. - Is this article one-sided?","Please read this article and answer the question below. 

What is the Best Diet for a Healthy Lifestyle? 

A New Study Seeks to Provide Answers 


It's a frequently asked question about diet: How much do carbs really matter when it comes to health? Now, a new study suggests that eating either a low-carb or a high-carb diet raises your risk of death, with people eating carbs in moderation seeing the greatest benefits to their health. 



Less than 40% or more than 70% of your energy or calories coming from carbohydrates was associated with the greatest risk of mortality. Eating moderate levels between that range offered the best options for a healthy lifespan. The lowest risk of an early death was seen where carbs made up 50-55% of a person's diet, according to the study published in The Lancet Public Health. 



The new research seeks to answer the question of which is the best diet for a healthy lifestyle. 



Respected researchers and nutritionists have argued passionately that if we could just consume pasta, bagels, and cookies in moderation, that'd be better than any other diet when it comes to keeping weight off and living a long, healthy life. 



The Lancet study results came as no surprise to some nutrition experts. ""No aspect of nutrition is so frequently discussed as the low-carb versus high-carb question. These data suggest that we shouldn't be eliminating a food staple like carbohydrates from our diet, nor should we be overconsuming them,_ said Jim Levenson, a dietician with Chicago's Northwestern Memorial Hospital. 



This new information about what's the best diet for health has many people thinking about their own carbohydrate consumption. __utrition is high up on everybody's mind with questions about what we should eat. This study gives us some important answers about the right balance of carbs to have in our diet,_ said 56-year-old Wicker Park resident Ruth Collins. - Is this article one-sided?","Please read this article and answer the question below. 

The Scientific Consensus on Global Warming


Climate research shows that the temperature of the Earth has been increasing every decade since the 1970s. It is also established that the burning of fossil fuels releases heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas emissions have been directly linked to global warming and climate change. 

A recent survey of scientists has found that the greater their expertise in climate science, the stronger their agreement on human-caused global warming. 

Among climate scientists who are actively publishing research into climate, 97 out of 100 agree that global warming is a direct consequence of the burning of fossil fuels by humans. 

Overwhelming agreement is also found in published climate research. An analysis of 21 years of climate research found that 97.1% of relevant papers agree with the consensus. Papers rejecting the consensus are a vanishingly small minority. Surveys of the climate science community and analysis of published climate research both find the same result. 

Based on the evidence, 97% of climate scientists have concluded that human-caused climate change is happening. Fossil fuel and political groups try to cast doubt on climate science, in order to delay regulation of the fossil fuel industry. They do this by manufacturing the appearance of an ongoing scientific debate. The __ake debate_ strategy was pioneered by the tobacco industry in the 1970s. They used doctors and scientists to reassure the public that smoking didn__ cause health problems. These spokespeople were either non-experts or among the small minority of scientists who dissented from the scientific consensus that smoking is bad for you. 

However, in the public__ eye, this conveyed the appearance of ongoing scientific debate. The __obacco Strategy_ is being used again, but this time to cast doubt on climate science. Less than 3% of climate scientists disagree with the consensus position that humans are causing global warming. However, when the media present the views of a dissenting scientist alongside a mainstream scientist, the public comes away with the mistaken impression of a 50:50 debate. Ironically, the journalistic standard of giving both sides equal weight has ended up distorting the state of climate science. - Is this article one-sided?","Please read this article and answer the question below. 

Leading Physician Groups Discuss When,

How Often Women Should Be Screened For Breast Cancer



Discussion about breast cancer screening for women is underway. Last week the American College of Physicians (ACP) issued its new guidelines on when and how often women should be screened for breast cancer.



TheACP now says that average-risk women should get mammograms every other year, starting at age 50. The group stated that annual mammograms can sometimes do more harm than good, from false positive results to unnecessary biopsies and surgeries. There's plenty of agreement about that, and lots of advice for women. - Is this article one-sided?","Please read this article and answer the question below. 

A Glass of Wine a Day or Just Say No?

Research on the Benefits and Harms of Alcohol Keeps Changing

We've been told for years that drinking alcohol in moderation having a glass of wine or a beer with dinner each day is not only harmless to our health, but may actually protect our heart and thus help us live longer. This message is part of U.S. national nutrition guidance and is supported by organizations including the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association. 


Now, some health experts have begun to question that dietary advice, given evidence that moderate drinking may not be so harm-less after all. A new study, published Thursday in The Lancet, adds more fuel to the fire, calling into question the long-held conclusion that moderate alcohol consumption is safe. The study found that consuming alcohol is associated with 2.8 million deaths globally each year.


""Our results show that the safest level of drinking is none,"" the authors of the new study state. ""This level is in conflict with most health guidelines, which describe the health benefits of consuming up to two drinks per day.""


However, Dr. Jonathan Peters, a professor at the University of Cambridge, noted that the study does not account for all benefits of alcohol consumption: ""Given the pleasure presumably associated with moderate drinking, claiming there is no 'safe level' is absurd. There is no safe level of driving, but governments do not recommend that people avoid driving.""


In fact, research published just a few months ago suggested that there are health benefits from drinking. A team of neurologists at the University of California, Irvine, determined that drinking two glasses of beer or wine per day actually decreased chances of premature death by 18 percent.

Benefits of Supplements Cast in Doubt by New Research


One of the most contentious questions in nutrition science over the past decade has been whether older adults should be taking supplemental vitamin D and calcium. As the world's population ages and broken bones and fractures become even more of a public health concern, researchers have been trying to make sense of conflicting studies on the association between supplements and fracture risk.


Do calcium and vitamin D supplements actually help protect the bones? Turns out, it depends who you ask.


A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association recently took a fresh look at this issue by analyzing 33 randomized clinical trials involving more than 50,000 adults over age 50. Each of these previous research papers compared calcium, vitamin D, or both with a placebo (sugar pill) or no treatment.

""We should not be telling older adults to take vitamin D and calcium,"" said Dr. Sandra Jones, a prominent nutrition researcher who was not involved in the study.


However, not everyone agreed. Dr. Daniel Howard, another researcher, said the study's conclusions are ""too broad."" He criticized the study for focusing on only the healthiest elderly, those who live at home.


Adding to the confusion, the new study only looked at bone health, and not the benefits or risks of supplements on other conditions. Previous studies have suggested that these supplements can lower risks of conditions like diabetes and certain cancers. 

Public health research has suggested for a long time that calcium and vitamin D are important to bone maintenance, and the best way to get the daily recommended doses are the natural way. For calcium, that means eating dairy products like milk, cheese, yogurt, or calcium-rich leafy greens. For vitamin D, that means getting some sun exposure. Older adults can also lower their risk of fractures by maintaining a healthy weight and doing exercises to improve strength, balance, and coordination.

On the other side are equally reputable researchers and nutritionists who haven't bought into the low-carb claims. They instead argue that most studies show low-carb diets aren't better than any other diet when it comes to keeping weight off and living a long, healthy life.

Scientists Debate Causes of Climate Change

Scientists have released a controversial new report concluding that humans are causing most of global warming. 

The report is an assessment of different lines of evidence, including thermometer measurements, satellite data and observations of ocean temperature. __here are a number of distinctive patterns being observed in our climate,_ said climate scientist Dr Jason Griffiths from the University of California, one of the lead authors of the report. __ut together, these patterns strengthen the evidence that humans are causing global warming. They also eliminate other possible natural causes._ The report lists different lines of evidence supporting human-caused global warming. __atellites are measuring less heat escaping to space because heat trapping greenhouse gases are absorbing more heat,_ said Dr Jones. __ther expected patterns of greenhouse warming have also been observed. For example, winters warming faster than summers is a characteristic pattern of warming from greenhouse gases._ 


However, other scientists have criticised the report for not including the views of scientists who disagree with the mainstream position. Dr Bertram Pearse, a climate expert from George Mason University, commented, __his report ignores the fact that eminent climate scientists, who have published hundreds of peer-reviewed papers between them, argue that humans have not had a significant effect on climate. 


Climate change is still hotly debated among scientists._ Dr Smith has published studies questioning the link between human activity and climate change. __ key driver of climate is variations in solar activity,_ Smith explains. __he sun provides almost all the energy in our climate system. When the sun gets warmer, our planet gets warmer.
